This reference book is a collection of insights into the immunoglobulin genes in the B cell repertoires of Rhesus macaques (RMs), based on the largest integrated dataset of antibody repertoire and long-read genomic sequencing data from 106 Indian-origin RMs. It explores the dynamics between known and novel alleles, as well as the relationship between expressed and genomic alleles.

The book provides:

-   A visual summary of alleles, categorized by gene types, , and Allele-Specific Clusters (ASC).

-   A detailed allele table, including coding and non-coding region information such as RSS and leader sequences.

-   Interactive graphs and frequency distributions at the ASC level, enabling users to explore allele-specific thresholds, absolute frequencies, zygosity, genotyping summaries, and the relationship between expressed and genomic alleles, providing insights into repertoire diversity and allele selection.

With a user-friendly interface, the Reference Book enables in-depth exploration of IG data, facilitating research into allele distributions, relationships, and population-level variations in RM immune repertoires.
