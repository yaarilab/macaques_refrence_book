    "text": "We identified cases where an allele appears in the repertoire but does not have an exact match in the genome. An ‘exact match’ means that Digger identified the allele as functional or as an open reading frame (ORF) without any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or, in the case of a novel allele, with the same SNP as identified by TIgGER. For each allele exhibiting this type of discrepancy in one or more subjects, we summarized the cases pertaining to that allele:\n\nyes: Found in the repertoire and exactly matched in the assembly.\nyes didn’t pass lk: Found with low confidence (lk&lt;1) in the repertoire and exactly matched in the assembly.\nno: Found in the repertoire but didn’t exactly match in the assembly.\nno didn’t pass lk: Found with low confidence (lk&lt;1) in the repertoire but didn’t exactly match in the assembly.\n\nIn the detailed analysis, it was found that out of the 114 IGHV clusters identified in the AIRRseq genotypes, 1 were not identified with exact match in the assembly of any of the 25 subjects analyzed. 45 out of 493 IGHV alleles identified in the AIRRseq genotypes were not identified with exact match in any subject assembly. 84 were identified with exact match in the assembly of some subjects, but not in others."

    "text": "For the genotype inference we applied a pre-genotype filter that required sequences to have no mutations within the V region, a single V allele assignment, and alignment starting from position one of the V germline. Only alleles having a threshold z Score above 0 were retained. For IGHD genotype inference, the selection was further refined by including only sequences with no mutations in the D region and a single assigned D allele. Additionally, only alleles that exceeded the z-score threshold above 4 were retained. For each allele, the median ratio of sequence length observed in the repertoire to the allele length was calculated using sequences annotated with that specific IGHD allele from subjects carrying the allele in their genotype, considering only alleles where the ratio was above 0.5.\nThe Piglet allele-based method was used for genotype inference based on AIRR-seq data. It compares allele usage against a population-derived threshold to determine allele inclusion in the genotype. A z score is calculated for each allele, measuring its significance in the repertoire. The formula incorporates allele count, frequency threshold, and repertoire depth, with higher z scores indicating a stronger likelihood of allele presence in the genotype.\nIn a detailed analysis, it was found that of the 143 existing IGHV clusters, 30 are not represented in the genotypes of the 106 subjects analyzed. 602 out of 1054 existing IGHV alleles were not found in the genotypes of the subjects.\nThere are 268 IGHV novel allele that were found in the genotypes of these 106 subjects."

    "text": "The genotype inference was conducted using a Bayesian method, which accounts for up to four alleles per ASC. However, in a single organism, a genotype can rarely comprise more than four distinct alleles, when multiple gene duplications occur and the loci exhibit heterozygosity both within and between these duplications. Our current analysis suggests that, for some ASCs, the inclusion of more than four alleles per genotype may be required, as can be shown, for example, for subject RFj17 in panel B."
