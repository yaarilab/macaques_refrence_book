    "text": "We identified cases where an allele appears in the repertoire but does not have an exact match in the genome. An ‘exact match’ means that Digger identified the allele as functional or as an open reading frame (ORF) without any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or, in the case of a novel allele, with the same SNP as identified by TIgGER. For each allele exhibiting this type of discrepancy in one or more subjects, we summarized the cases pertaining to that allele:\n\nyes: Found in the repertoire and exactly matched in the assembly.\nyes didn’t pass lk: Found with low confidence (lk&lt;1) in the repertoire and exactly matched in the assembly.\nno: Found in the repertoire but didn’t exactly match in the assembly.\nno didn’t pass lk: Found with low confidence (lk&lt;1) in the repertoire but didn’t exactly match in the assembly.\n\nIn the detailed analysis, it was found that out of the 114 IGHV clusters identified in the AIRRseq genotypes, 1 were not identified with exact match in the assembly of any of the 25 subjects analyzed. 45 out of 493 IGHV alleles identified in the AIRRseq genotypes were not identified with exact match in any subject assembly. 84 were identified with exact match in the assembly of some subjects, but not in others."

    "text": "The genotype inference was conducted using a Bayesian method, which accounts for up to four alleles per ASC. However, in a single organism, a genotype can rarely comprise more than four distinct alleles, when multiple gene duplications occur and the loci exhibit heterozygosity both within and between these duplications. Our current analysis suggests that, for some ASCs, the inclusion of more than four alleles per genotype may be required, as can be shown, for example, for subject RFj17 in panel B."
