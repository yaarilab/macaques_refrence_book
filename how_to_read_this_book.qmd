This Reference Book is structured hierarchically to allow for intuitive exploration of Rhesus Macaque immunoglobulin genes. The book is organized as follows:

1.  Each tab represents a different IG chain (e.g., [IGH](IGH.html) , [IGL](IGL.html), [IGK](IGK.html)).

2.  Within each chain

    2.1  The main page have the Allele table([IGH](IGH.html#allele-table), [IGL](IGL.html#allele-table), [IGK](IGK.html#allele-table)) and Allele visual Summary([IGH](IGH.html#Allele-visual-summary), [IGL](IGL.html#Allele-visual-summary), [IGK](IGK.html#Allele-visual-summary)).

    2.2  The main chapters are divided by gene type (e.g., IGHV, IGHD, IGHJ for the heavy chain).

3.  Each gene type is further categorized by subgroup.

4.  Within each subgroup, the book showcases information on different ASCs.
